"Nadal began the year in India, where he was comprehensively beaten by Mikhail Youzhny in the final of the Chennai Open. 
Nadal then reached the semifinals of the Australian Open for the first time. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Nadal in the semifinal
 of 2008 Australian Open. Nadal also reached the final of the Miami Masters for the second time.
During the spring clay-court season, Nadal won four singles titles and defeated Roger Federer in three finals. 
He beat Federer at the Masters Series Monte Carlo for the third straight year, capturing his Open Era record fourth 
consecutive title there. He won in straight sets, despite Federer's holding a 4–0 lead in the second set.[49] 
Nadal then won his fourth consecutive title at the Open Sabadell Atlántico tournament in Barcelona. A few weeks later,
 Nadal won his first title at the Masters Series Hamburg, defeating Federer in the three-set final. He then won the French Open, 
becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam singles title without losing a set.[50] He defeated Federer in 
the final for the third straight year, but this was the most lopsided of all their matches, as Nadal only lost four games 
and gave Federer his first bagel since 1999.[49] This was Nadal's fourth consecutive French title, tying Björn Borg's all-time
 record. Nadal became the fourth male player during Open era to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament four consecutive
 years (the others being Borg, Pete Sampras, and Federer)."
